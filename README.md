Kodchasan
Based on a Thai traditional loop teen handwriting. Kodchasan gives a flavor of cuteness but yet not too fun or being funny. Formal and controlled handwriting that can be useful for anything associate with teen and casual announcement. A little flare of feminist handwriting makes this face more gentle and soft spoken. Designed by Kansuda Peamprajakpong as a part of SIPA Thailandâ€™s National fonts project.
